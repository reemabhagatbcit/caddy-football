                        sources:
                    </li>
                    <li>Directly from You. For example, from the forms You complete on our Service, preferences You
                        express or provide through our Service, or from Your purchases on our Service.
                    </li>

                    </li>

                        Service, third-party vendors for payment processing, or other third-party vendors that We use to
                        provide the Service to You.<br>
                        Use of Personal Information for Business Purposes or Commercial Purposes<br>
                        We may use or disclose personal information We collect for "business purposes" or "commercial
                        purposes" (as defined under the CCPA), which may include the following examples:
                    </li>
                    <li>To operate our Service and provide You with our Service.
                    </li>
                    <li>To provide You with support and to respond to Your inquiries, including to investigate and

                    </li>
                    <li>To fulfill or meet the reason You provided the information. For example, if You share Your
                        contact information to ask a question about our Service, We will use that personal information
                        to respond to Your inquiry. If You provide Your personal information to purchase a product or
                        service, We will use that information to process Your payment and facilitate delivery.
                    </li>
                    <li>To respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or

                    </li>
                    <li>For internal administrative and auditing purposes.
                    </li>
                    <li>To detect security incidents and protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal
                        activity,
                        including, when necessary, to prosecute those responsible for such activities.<br>
                        Please note that the examples provided above are illustrative and not intended to be exhaustive.
                        For more details on how we use this information, please refer to the "Use of Your Personal Data"
                        section.
                        If We decide to collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal
                        information We collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes We will
                        update this Privacy Policy.<br>
                        Disclosure of Personal Information for Business Purposes or Commercial Purposes<br>
                        We may use or disclose and may have used or disclosed in the last twelve (12) months the
                        following categories of personal information for business or commercial purposes:
                    </li>

                    <li>Category B: Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute
                        (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e))
                    </li>
                    <li>Category D: Commercial information</li>
                    <li>Category F: Internet or other similar network activity<br>
                        Please note that the categories listed above are those defined in the CCPA. This does not mean
                        that all examples of that category of personal information were in fact disclosed, but reflects
                        our good faith belief to the best of our knowledge that some of that information from the
                        applicable category may be and may have been disclosed.<br>
                        When We disclose personal information for a business purpose or a commercial purpose, We enter a
                        contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal
                        information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.<br>
                        Sale of Personal Information<br>
                        As defined in the CCPA, "sell" and "sale" mean selling, renting, releasing, disclosing,
                        disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or
                        by electronic or other means, a consumer's personal information by the business to a third party
                        for valuable consideration. This means that We may have received some kind of benefit in return
                        for sharing personal information, but not necessarily a monetary benefit.<br>
                        Please note that the categories listed below are those defined in the CCPA. This does not mean
                        that all examples of that category of personal information were in fact sold, but reflects our
                        good faith belief to the best of our knowledge that some of that information from the applicable
                        category may be and may have been shared for value in return.<br>
                        We may sell and may have sold in the last twelve (12) months the following categories of
                        personal information:
                    </li>
                    <li>Category A: Identifiers</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>Category F: Internet or other similar network activity<br>
                        Share of Personal Information<br>
                        We may share Your personal information identified in the above categories with the following
                        categories of third parties:
                    </li>
                    <li>Service Providers
                    </li>

                    <li>Third party vendors to whom You or Your agents authorize Us to disclose Your personal

                        Sale of Personal Information of Minors Under 16 Years of Age <br>
                        We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under the age of 16 through our
                        Service, although certain third party websites that we link to may do so. These third-party
                        websites have their own terms of use and privacy policies and we encourage parents and legal
                        guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and instruct their children to never
                        provide information on other websites without their permission.<br>
                        We do not sell the personal information of Consumers We actually know are less than 16 years of
                        age, unless We receive affirmative authorization (the "right to opt-in") from either the
                        Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less
                        than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to the sale of personal information may opt-out of
                        future sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt-out, You (or Your authorized
                        representative) may submit a request to Us by contacting Us.<br>
                        If You have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 (or 16) has provided Us with
                        personal information, please contact Us with sufficient detail to enable Us to delete that
                        information.<br>

                        Any disclosures We provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable
                        request's receipt. <br>
                        For data portability requests, We will select a format to provide Your personal information that
                        is readily usable and should allow You to transmit the information from one entity to another
                        entity without hindrance.<br>

                        that information.<br>
